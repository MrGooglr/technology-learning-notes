## JMS Overview

1. **Messaging** is a method of communication between software components or applications.
1. Messaging enables distributed communication that is **loosely coupled**.
1. The sender and the receiver need to know only which message format(as per the application we are going to communicate) and which destination to use.
1. In this respect, messaging differs from **tightly coupled technologies**, such as **Remote Method Invocation (RMI)**, which require an application to know a remote applicationâ€™s methods.

> ***NOTE*** 
> Messaging also differs from electronic mail (email), which is a method of communication between people or between software applications and people. Messaging is used for communication between software applications or software components.
